# PUSH Improvement Proposals (PIPs)

Before you initiate a pull request, please read the [PIP-1](./PIPs/pip-1-workflow-index.md) process document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed on [Push discord](https://discord.gg/YVPB99F9W5) or [Push forum](https://gov.push.org/c/pip/29) .

## What are PIPs?

PIPs defines the standards in the Push protocol ecosystem in which anyone can create, amend these proposals by submitting them. The goal of the PIP project is to document standardized protocols for Push nodes, payload standards, applications and to document them in a high quality and implementable way.

## How to submit a PIP?

Start by duplicating the [template](../pip-template.md) and submitting a PR in <code>/consideration</code> folder. Read the [proposal lifecycle](../pip-lifecycle.md) to understand the lifecycle of the proposal.

## What are different Types, Categories, Subcategories, Niche in PIP?

Read [definitions](../definitions) to understand types, categories, subcategories, and niches.

## Understanding nomenclature of PIP submission?

All PIPs rest under <code>/consideration</code> folder. Once a PIP is finalized, it is duplicated and moved to the PIPs folder. If a PIP is living, then its link is moved here.
